<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ICU Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automated</li><li>Fully automated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>ICU Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) are crucial devices used in emergency cardiac situations. The market is primarily categorized into semi-automated and fully automated AEDs. Semi-automated AEDs require user intervention to deliver a shock after advising the rescuer, ensuring safety during critical moments. In contrast, fully automated AEDs analyze the heart rhythm and deliver shocks autonomously, reducing the need for user decision-making. Both types are essential for improving survival rates in cardiac arrest cases, offering varying levels of intervention support.</p></p>
